# declare-zsh

[**declare-zsh**](https://github.com/zdharma/declare-zsh) is a parser for `zinit` commands in `.zshrc`. It allows to
perform the following actions on `.zshrc` **from the command-line**:

- enable and disable selected plugins and snippets,
- add plugins and snippets,
- delete plugins and snippets,
- it currently supports the classic Zinit syntax only, i.e.: the one with two (`zinit ice …`, `zinit load/snippet …`)
  commands.

______________________________________________________________________

In other words, by issuing a `declzsh` command the user deploys a task of:

1. Reading and parsing of the `~/.zshrc`.

1. Making changes (like removal of a plugin, i.e. of `zinit load {the-removed-plugin}` command together with the
   possible associated `zinit ice …` command) and then…

1. Writing the result back to the `zshrc` (by default, the result is stored to `~/.zshrc_gen` file for safety, but the
   author wants to emhasize very strongly, that **breaking something within the parsed `zshrc` is nearly impossible**
   and the tool can be safely used with option `-o ~/.zshrc` which points `declzsh` to the original `zshrc` as the
   destination output file).

## Examples & Screenshots

1. Example **disabling** of a plugin via the **toggle** option **-TT** – this works because the commands preceded by `:`
   are ignored by the shell: ![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/declare-zsh/master/img/toggle.png)

1. Example **addition** of a plugin via the option **-AA** – in order to also set up ice modifiers enclose them in a
   preceding square-bracket block, i.e. `declzsh -AA '[ wait"1" lucid ] zdharma/null'`:

1. Example **deletion** of a plugin via the **purge** option **-PP** – the argument is treated as pattern, pass `*` to
   delete all plugins and snippets!:

## Usage

Multiple actions, i.e. multiple options like `-AA`, `-PP`, `-DD`, etc. are possible in a single `declzsh` run.
